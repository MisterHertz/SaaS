Statistical Test (Kruskal-Wallis) – Compared regions since data was non-normal

## Key Insights

Sales volume alone does not guarantee profitability

Significant differences exist in profit-to-sales ratios across AMER, EMEA, and APJ

Some regions generate higher revenue but lower profit margins due to cost structures

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy

Tableau: Dashboards & visualization

Jupyter Notebook: Analysis & reporting
